# Hand Gesture Controlled System Volume using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI

## Description
This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to control system volume through hand movements and gestures. Leveraging the power of OpenCV for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, along with MediaPipe for robust hand landmarks detection, and PyAutoGUI for automating system volume adjustments, this application offers an intuitive and hands-free approach to manage audio levels.

## Key Features
- *Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV*
- *Accurate hand landmarks detection with MediaPipe*
- *Gesture recognition for volume control*
- *Seamless integration with PyAutoGUI for system volume adjustments*
- *User-friendly interface with visual feedback for recognized gestures*

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy
2. Run the main script:
   ## python main.py
3. Position your hand in front of the camera and perform gestures to control the system volume.
Enjoy hands-free volume adjustment!
